# [LFL Coding Challenge]

Given the following list of places, use JS to produce a script that orders the locations by distance to the LFL office (510 Victoria, Venice, CA).  
You may use whatever geocoding service you’d like, but you will probably find most luck using Google Maps' Geocoding API.

Places:
Times Square, Manhattan, NY 10036
13000 S Dakota 244, Keystone, SD 57751
1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500
Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, CA 94129
Stonehenge, A344, Amesbury, Wiltshire SP4 7DE, United Kingdom
Great Wall of China
Hollywood Sign, Los Angeles, CA

## Quick start

Nothing special is needed to run the code. But do make sure that you supply a valid Google Maps Javascript API Key

## Features

* Configurable origin (TODO: UI needs to reflect non-default address)
* Will consolidate all destinations into a single call to save bandwidth 
* TODO: Cleanup how debug statements are laid out in the code
